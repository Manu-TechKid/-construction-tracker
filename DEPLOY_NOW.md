## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### STEP 1: Push to GitHub (Render Backend)

Run these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\hintels\Desktop\sitegroud host\-construction-tracker-main"

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix: Calendar alignment (both pages), invoice date field, schedule visibility, admin dashboard, project routes"

# Push to GitHub (triggers Render auto-deploy)
git push origin main
```

**What happens next:**
- Render detects the push automatically
- Backend builds and deploys (~5-10 minutes)
- Health check validates deployment
- New features go live

---

### STEP 2: Upload to SiteGround (Frontend)

#### Option A: Manual Upload via cPanel File Manager

1. **Locate build files:**
   ```
   c:\Users\hintels\Desktop\sitegroud host\-construction-tracker-main\client\build
   ```

2. **Login to SiteGround:**
   - Go to: https://my.siteground.com
   - Navigate to: Site Tools ‚Üí File Manager

3. **Upload build folder:**
   - Navigate to your public_html directory
   - Delete old files (backup first!)
   - Upload all files from `client/build` folder
   - Extract if compressed

4. **Set permissions:**
   - All files: 644
   - All folders: 755

#### Option B: FTP Upload (Recommended for large files)

1. **Download FileZilla:** https://filezilla-project.org/

2. **Connect to SiteGround:**
   - Host: Your SiteGround FTP hostname
   - Username: Your SiteGround username
   - Password: Your SiteGround password
   - Port: 21

3. **Upload files:**
   - Local: `c:\Users\hintels\Desktop\sitegroud host\-construction-tracker-main\client\build`
   - Remote: `/public_html/` or your subdomain folder
   - Upload all files from build folder

#### Option C: Using SiteGround Git (Advanced)

```bash
# If you have SSH access to SiteGround
ssh your-username@your-site.com
cd public_html
git clone https://github.com/your-username/construction-tracker.git
cd construction-tracker/client

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### SiteGround Deployment
- **API URL:** Ensure `REACT_APP_API_URL` points to your Render backend
- **Location:** Check `client/.env` or `client/.env.production`
- **Should be:** `https://your-render-app.onrender.com/api/v1`

### Build Files
- **Size:** 522.87 kB (gzipped)
- **Location:** `client/build/`
- **Upload:** All files and folders inside `build/` directory

### First Load After Deployment
- Users may need to **hard refresh** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- Clear browser cache if issues persist
- Service worker may cache old version

---

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Calendar still shows wrong day?
```powershell
# Rebuild client
cd "c:\Users\hintels\Desktop\sitegroud host\-construction-tracker-main\client"
npm run build
# Re-upload build folder to SiteGround
```

### Invoice date field missing?
- Verify backend deployed (check Render dashboard)
- Check browser console for errors
- Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)

### Admin dashboard 404?
- Verify you're logged in as Admin/Manager
- Check route: `/workers/admin-dashboard`
- Verify build uploaded correctly

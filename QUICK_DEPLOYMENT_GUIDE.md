## 📋 How to Use New Features

### Invoice Date Field
**Location:** Invoices → Create New Invoice

**How it works:**
1. Select building
2. Set **Invoice Date** (can be any date - past or future)
3. Set **Due Date** (must be after invoice date)
4. Invoice date is the "official" date, not system date

**Example:** 
- Today is October 9
- You want September 29 invoice
- Set Invoice Date: September 29, 2025
- Set Due Date: October 29, 2025 (30 days payment term)

### Admin Worker Dashboard
**Location:** Workers → Admin Dashboard (or direct: `/workers/admin-dashboard`)

**Who can access:** Admin and Manager only

**Features:**
- See all workers at a glance
- View weekly hours
- Generate employment letters
- Quick actions menu per worker

**Tabs:**
1. **All Workers** - Full worker list with contact info
2. **Weekly Hours** - Link to time tracking
3. **Employment Letters** - Generate letters per worker

# Time Tracking Features - New Implementation

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive time tracking system for the Construction Tracker application.

## Overview

The time tracking system will allow workers to clock in/out, track work progress, and provide real-time location verification for construction sites. This system will integrate seamlessly with existing work orders and worker management.

## Core Features

### 1. Clock In/Out System
- **Digital Time Clock**: Workers can clock in/out using mobile devices
- **Location Verification**: GPS validation to ensure workers are at correct job sites
- **Photo Verification**: Optional photo capture during clock in/out for verification
- **Offline Support**: Cache clock events when offline, sync when connection restored

### 2. Work Order Integration
- **Automatic Association**: Clock events automatically linked to active work orders
- **Task-Level Tracking**: Track time spent on specific tasks within work orders
- **Progress Updates**: Workers can update work progress during active sessions
- **Break Management**: Track breaks and lunch periods separately

### 3. Real-Time Monitoring
- **Live Dashboard**: Supervisors can see who's currently working and where
- **Geofencing**: Automatic alerts when workers leave designated work areas
- **Status Updates**: Real-time work status and progress notifications
- **Team Coordination**: See other team members working on same projects

### 4. Mobile-First Design
- **Progressive Web App**: Works on all mobile devices without app store installation
- **Touch-Friendly Interface**: Large buttons and simple navigation for field use
- **Quick Actions**: One-tap clock in/out and status updates
- **Offline Capability**: Full functionality without internet connection

## Technical Requirements

### Backend API Endpoints

#### Time Tracking Routes
```
POST /api/v1/time-tracking/clock-in
POST /api/v1/time-tracking/clock-out
GET /api/v1/time-tracking/status/:workerId
GET /api/v1/time-tracking/sessions
PUT /api/v1/time-tracking/sessions/:sessionId
DELETE /api/v1/time-tracking/sessions/:sessionId
```

#### Location Tracking Routes
```
POST /api/v1/location/update
GET /api/v1/location/worker/:workerId
GET /api/v1/location/workorder/:workOrderId
POST /api/v1/location/geofence/check
```

### Database Schema

#### TimeSession Model
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  worker: ObjectId, // Reference to User
  workOrder: ObjectId, // Reference to WorkOrder
  building: ObjectId, // Reference to Building
  clockInTime: Date,
  clockOutTime: Date,
  totalHours: Number,
  breakTime: Number, // Minutes
  status: String, // 'active', 'completed', 'paused'
  location: {
    clockIn: {
      latitude: Number,
      longitude: Number,
      accuracy: Number,
      timestamp: Date
    },
    clockOut: {
      latitude: Number,
      longitude: Number,
      accuracy: Number,
      timestamp: Date
    }
  },
  photos: [{
    url: String,
    type: String, // 'clock-in', 'clock-out', 'progress'
    timestamp: Date
  }],
  notes: String,
  progressUpdates: [{
    timestamp: Date,
    progress: Number, // Percentage
    notes: String
  }],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

#### LocationLog Model
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  worker: ObjectId,
  timeSession: ObjectId,
  location: {
    latitude: Number,
    longitude: Number,
    accuracy: Number
  },
  timestamp: Date,
  isWithinGeofence: Boolean,
  geofenceRadius: Number // meters
}
```

### Frontend Components

#### Worker Mobile Interface
- `TimeTrackingDashboard.jsx` - Main worker interface
- `ClockInOutButton.jsx` - Primary clock in/out control
- `LocationPermissionRequest.jsx` - Handle location permissions
- `OfflineIndicator.jsx` - Show offline status
- `ProgressUpdateForm.jsx` - Update work progress
- `PhotoCapture.jsx` - Camera integration for verification

#### Supervisor Dashboard
- `LiveTrackingDashboard.jsx` - Real-time worker monitoring
- `WorkerLocationMap.jsx` - Map view of worker locations
- `TimeReports.jsx` - Time tracking reports and analytics
- `GeofenceManager.jsx` - Manage work site boundaries

## User Experience Flow

### Worker Flow
1. **Morning Check-in**
   - Open app on mobile device
   - Select work order for the day
   - Allow location access
   - Take optional photo
   - Tap "Clock In"

2. **During Work**
   - App runs in background tracking location
   - Update progress as work progresses
   - Take break (pause timer)
   - Resume work (restart timer)

3. **End of Day**
   - Tap "Clock Out"
   - Confirm location
   - Take optional completion photo
   - Add final notes
   - Submit timesheet

### Supervisor Flow
1. **Morning Overview**
   - View dashboard showing all workers
   - See who has clocked in
   - Check work order assignments
   - Monitor location compliance

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Track worker locations on map
   - Receive geofence alerts
   - Monitor work progress updates
   - Communicate with field teams

3. **End of Day Review**
   - Review all timesheets
   - Approve/reject time entries
   - Generate reports
   - Plan next day assignments

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Location Encryption**: All GPS data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for viewing location data
- **Data Retention**: Automatic deletion of location logs after 90 days
- **Privacy Settings**: Workers can view their own tracking data

### Compliance
- **GDPR Compliance**: Full data portability and deletion rights
- **Labor Law Compliance**: Accurate time tracking for wage calculations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all time tracking events

## Performance Requirements

### Mobile Performance
- **Battery Optimization**: Minimal battery drain during tracking
- **Data Usage**: Efficient sync to minimize cellular data usage
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for all user interactions
- **Offline Storage**: 30 days of offline time tracking data

### Server Performance

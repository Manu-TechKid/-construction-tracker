## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Still seeing old calendar dates
**Fix:**
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Verify files uploaded correctly
4. Check file timestamps in SiteGround

### Problem: "Worker Management" not in sidebar
**Fix:**
1. Verify you're logged in as **Admin** or **Manager**
2. Hard refresh browser
3. Check if all files uploaded (especially main.js)
4. Re-upload build folder

### Problem: Invoice Date field missing
**Fix:**
1. Check backend deployed to Render
2. Visit: https://your-render-app.onrender.com/api/v1/health
3. Should show "healthy"
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for Render deployment

### Problem: 404 errors on navigation
**Fix:** Need `.htaccess` file in SiteGround

Create file: `public_html/.htaccess`
```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

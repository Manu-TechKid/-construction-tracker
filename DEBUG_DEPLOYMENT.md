# üîç DEBUG DEPLOYMENT - ROOT CAUSE FOUND

## ‚ùå **THE ISSUE:**

**Your LOCAL build is CORRECT:**
- ‚úÖ `index.html` references `main.f33a7743.js`
- ‚úÖ `main.f33a7743.js` exists (1.9MB)
- ‚úÖ `asset-manifest.json` is correct

**But browser STILL requests `main.2f9271d0.js` (OLD file)**

**This means:** You have NOT uploaded the NEW files to SiteGround correctly!

---

## üîç **VERIFICATION STEPS:**

### Step 1: Check What's Actually on SiteGround

**Open these URLs directly in browser:**

1. **https://admin.servicesdsj.com/index.html**
   - View source
   - Look for: `<script defer="defer" src="/static/js/main.XXXXXX.js"></script>`
   - **If it says `main.2f9271d0.js`** ‚Üí You uploaded OLD index.html
   - **Should say `main.f33a7743.js`** ‚Üí Correct

2. **https://admin.servicesdsj.com/static/js/main.f33a7743.js**
   - Should return JavaScript code
   - **If returns HTML error page** ‚Üí File not uploaded
   - **If returns JavaScript** ‚Üí File uploaded correctly

3. **https://admin.servicesdsj.com/static/js/main.2f9271d0.js**
   - Should return 404 error
   - **If returns anything else** ‚Üí Old file still exists

### Issue 2: SiteGround File Manager Cache
**Problem:** SiteGround shows old files in interface

**Solution:**
1. Refresh SiteGround File Manager
2. Check actual file timestamps
3. Re-upload if timestamps are old

### Issue 3: You Have Multiple Domains/Subdomains
**Problem:** Uploading to wrong location

**Solution:**
1. Verify you're uploading to correct domain folder
2. Check if `admin.servicesdsj.com` points to subdomain folder
3. Upload to correct path

3. Create static/js folder
4. Upload main.f33a7743.js
5. Upload remaining files
6. Set permissions: files 644, folders 755
```

### 4. Immediate Verification

## üéØ **THE REAL ISSUE:**

**99% certain:** You have OLD files on SiteGround that you haven't properly replaced.

**Evidence:**
- Local build is perfect ‚úÖ
- Browser requests OLD file ‚ùå
- This only happens if server has OLD index.html

**Solution:** Complete server reset + fresh upload

---

## üìû **IF STILL FAILS:**

### Check These:
1. **Domain DNS:** Does `admin.servicesdsj.com` point to correct server?
2. **CDN/Proxy:** Using Cloudflare? Clear CDN cache
3. **SiteGround Cache:** Contact support to clear server cache
4. **Multiple Locations:** Files uploaded to wrong folder?

### Contact SiteGround Support:
```
"My website admin.servicesdsj.com is serving cached files. 
I uploaded new files but browser still requests old JavaScript file main.2f9271d0.js. 
Please clear all server-side caching for this domain."
```

---

## ‚úÖ **FINAL VERIFICATION:**

After upload, these URLs MUST work:
- ‚úÖ https://admin.servicesdsj.com/index.html (view source, check JS filename)
- ‚úÖ https://admin.servicesdsj.com/static/js/main.f33a7743.js (returns JavaScript)

**If these don't work, files aren't uploaded correctly!**

---

**The issue is 100% on the SiteGround side - your build is perfect!** üéØ

## 📤 Upload Instructions

### Using SiteGround File Manager (Recommended):
1. Go to your SiteGround File Manager (already open)
2. Navigate to `public_html` folder
3. Delete old files (except .htaccess)
4. Upload all files from the build folder
5. Make sure `config.js` is uploaded
6. Verify `static/` folder and its contents are uploaded

### Using FTP:
1. Connect to SiteGround via FTP
2. Navigate to `public_html`
3. Upload all files from `client/build/`
4. Preserve folder structure (especially `static/`)

## 🔍 Post-Upload Verification

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Visit**: https://admin.servicesdsj.com
3. **Check Console**: Open browser console (F12) and verify:
   - No 404 errors
   - API URL shows: `https://construction-tracker-backend.onrender.com/api/v1`
4. **Test Login**: Try logging in with your credentials

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **config.js is CRITICAL**: This file contains the API URL configuration
2. **Don't delete .htaccess**: It's already configured correctly
3. **Upload ALL static files**: The `static/` folder contains JS and CSS files
4. **Clear cache**: Users may need to clear browser cache to see updates

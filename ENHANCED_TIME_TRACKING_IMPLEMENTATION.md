2. Selects work order for the day
3. Allows location access
4. Takes optional photo
5. Taps "Clock In" - location and time recorded

### Scenario 2: Admin Approval Process
1. Admin opens "Projects Pending Approval" page
2. Reviews worker time sessions with photos and location data
3. Sees cost calculations and work details
4. Approves or rejects with notes
5. System updates worker records automatically

### Scenario 3: Progress Tracking
1. Worker updates progress during work session
2. Takes photos of completed work
3. Adds notes about progress made
4. System tracks progress percentage
5. Admin can monitor real-time progress

## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Database Schema
